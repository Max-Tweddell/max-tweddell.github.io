## What is this site's primary purpose?
The purpose of this site is for me to blog about things and stuff and to thsare the things and stuff that I think with other people.

## Who is my target audience?
I am not sure if I really have a target audience.


## How do I want visitors to interact with my site? What experience would I like them to have?
I think a basic one-way user experience would be ideal.
I want it to be able to be viewed well on all devices and I think and important part will be how fast it is and how much needs to be loaded.
This is especially important on a mobile platform
