# JavaScript

### Syntax and Stuff

there are three types of brackets
    ``[]{}()``

Round brackets or parentheses or parens for short are used for calling functions e.g ``getRandomNumber()``, for defining function method arguments eg function `function add10(x)`

Squiggly brackets `{}` are used for control flow and defining objects

Examples:
```javascript
function add10(x){ return x + 10 }
```

```javascript
{"id": "325061603332718593",
"timestamp": "2017-06-15T23:58:45.587000+00:00",
"content": "Hello World!",
"type": 0,
"tts": false,
"nonce": "331232382768119808",
"pinned": false,
"edited_timestamp": null,
"attachments": []}
```

In a function the squiggly brackets are used to define what is part of the function body and what is not.


single quotes `''` are used to define strings
Double quotes `""` are used for the same thing

The advantage of having to types of quotes means that it is easy to mix them
for example:   
```javascript  
var potato "She said 'potato'"
```

Most of the time I use double brackets, becuase in other languages single quotes are used to denote object literals.
