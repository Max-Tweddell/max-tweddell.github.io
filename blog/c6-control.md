## When programming, what causes some disproportionate responses?
This is a somewhat difficult question.
I guess the obvious answer is when the computer doesn't do why I want it to do. But I am not sure if this is really a valid answer.

The thing I like about programming is the computer doing what I want it to do, and solving problems and learning things.

There are two kinds of getting stuck, the one where  you have a problem that you know how to know how to get around, and the other where you have a problem that you think you know how to get around, but you can't, the computer isn't any having of it, you lose. Go home.

This latter one is annoying and when you find yourself with one of these problems it can be very frustrating, you become a bush lawyer.
It is like orienteering and thinking that the map is wrong. The map is never wrong. Computers are the same.

But once you start thinking like this you have to step back and take a break and not think about it, let the other part of your brain think about it.

## Siberian North Railroad exercise

This is something that was sort of familiar in a way.
As in, I naturally do something like this when I get annoyed with stuff to some extent but it is nice to have it written down, have it proper explained and fully developed. I really like this a lot.
