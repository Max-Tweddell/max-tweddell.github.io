<p>This is a somewhat difficult question. I guess the obvious answer is when the computer doesn’t do why I want it to do. But I am not sure if this is really a valid answer.</p>
<table style="width:6%;">
<colgroup>
<col width="5%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>The thing I like about programming is the computer doing what I want it to do, and solving problems and learning things.</td>

<p>There are two kinds of getting stuck, the one where you have a problem that you know how to know how to get around, and the other where you have a problem that you think you know how to get around, but you can’t, the computer isn’t any having of it, you lose. Go home.</p>
<p>This latter one is annoying and when you find yourself with one of these problems it can be very frustrating, you become a bush lawyer. It is like orienteering and thinking that the map is wrong. The map is never wrong. Computers are the same.</p>
<p>But once you start thinking like this you have to step back and take a break and not think about it, let the other part of your brain think about it.</p>

<p>This is something that was sort of familiar in a way. As in, I naturally do something like this when I get annoyed with stuff to some extent but it is nice to have it written down, have it proper explained and fully developed. I really like this a lot.</p>
